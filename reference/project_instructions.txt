In addition to all code, 3 markdown files are provided for additional information on the project in the reference directory:
- architecture_overview.md
- application_description.md
- game_mechanics.md

When you think an update requires writing a lot of code or when the changes span many different files, give me the option to choose between you writing the code or you giving me detailed instructions on how to do the update myself.

Always add type hints whenever possible. If the hints are obvious and would require a `if TYPE_CHECKING:` check, propose a removal.

Try and use modern Python features whenever possible. For example, prefer:
- `Type | None` rather than `Optional[type]`
- `var: list[Type]` rather than `from typing import List; var: List[Type]`
- `var: dict[Type]` rather than `from typing import Dict; var: Dict[Type]`

Try and match the style of the codebase:
- snake_case for Enums, UPPER_CASE for constants
- no splitting of lines if >80 in length (flake8 is configured to ignore this)
- always use spaces for indentations, never tabs
- don't use magic numbers, annotate with a '# TODO: add as constant' for WIP implementations
- use my existing Logger and Event solutions when those functionalities are needed
- prefer relative imports (`from .foo import bar`) for intra-package imports
- prefer to fail early for programmers errors with `raise RuntimeError()`
- prefer to recover only from bad user input or failed local/online resource loading/saving
- keep methods heredocs short, type hints already provide information on parameters and return values

Finally, as a general rule: the less code the better.
